### How to Draw a Star with SVG

A star is a simple shape. We could define it as a bunch of polygons and set each point individually. But then we would need to know each coordinate. Instead of that, we can define just one arm, and then repeat it five times with a rotation to get the same shape. We will use the `transform` attribute to set a rotation.

First, let's define an arm. In this example, each arm consists of two polygons.

<Example>

<SVG width="200" height="200" viewBox="-100 -100 200 200">
  <Polygon
    points="0,0 36,-50 0,-100"
    fill="#EDD8B7"
    data-element-id="polygon-1"
  />
  <Polygon
    points="0,0 -36,-50 0,-100"
    fill="#E5C39C"
    data-element-id="polygon-2"
  />
</SVG>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<svg 
  width="200"
  height="200"
  viewBox="-100 -100 200 200"
>
  <polygon
    points="0,0 36,-50 0,-100"
    fill="#EDD8B7" 
  />
  <polygon 
    points="0,0 -36,-50 0,-100"
    fill="#E5C39C" 
  />
</svg>
```

</Example>

We can group them with a `g` element and rotate them together. You can think of the `g` element as the `div` element in HTML. It can contain other elements and attributes defined on the group element apply to its children.

Then we `rotate` each arm into the correct position.

<Final>

```html "rotate"
<svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="-100 -100 200 200">
  <g transform="translate(0 5)">
    <g>
      <polygon points="0,0 36,-50 0,-100" fill="#EDD8B7" />
      <polygon points="0,0 -36,-50 0,-100" fill="#E5C39C" />
    </g>
    <g transform="rotate(72)">
      <polygon points="0,0 36,-50 0,-100" fill="#EDD8B7" />
      <polygon points="0,0 -36,-50 0,-100" fill="#E5C39C" />
    </g>
    <g transform="rotate(-72)">
      <polygon points="0,0 36,-50 0,-100" fill="#EDD8B7" />
      <polygon points="0,0 -36,-50 0,-100" fill="#E5C39C" />
    </g>
    <g transform="rotate(144)">
      <polygon points="0,0 36,-50 0,-100" fill="#EDD8B7" />
      <polygon points="0,0 -36,-50 0,-100" fill="#E5C39C" />
    </g>
    <g transform="rotate(-144)">
      <polygon points="0,0 36,-50 0,-100" fill="#EDD8B7" />
      <polygon points="0,0 -36,-50 0,-100" fill="#E5C39C" />
    </g>
  </g>
</svg>
```

</Final>

You might notice that we define our polygons to start from the origin of the coordinate system (which is the center of the image). By default, the rotation is also around the origin of the coordinate system.

Because we have five arms, the bottom of the image is a bit shorter than the top of the image. To center the image, we can group the whole star together and use the `translate` transformation to move everything down by 5 units along the Y coordinates.

In this example, we had to copy-paste the code for each arm over and over again. In [the next example](/svg/use), we will see how to reuse shapes.
