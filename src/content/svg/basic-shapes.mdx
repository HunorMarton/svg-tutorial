import { Circle as Embed } from "../../svg-curves/connected/Circle.tsx";
import SVG from "../../components/markdown/elements/SVG.astro";
import Circle from "../../components/markdown/elements/Circle.astro";
import Rect from "../../components/markdown/elements/Rect.astro";
import Example from "../../components/markdown/layouts/Example.astro";
import Note from "../../components/markdown/layouts/Note.astro";
import Final from "../../components/markdown/layouts/Final.astro";
import "./basic-shapes.scss";

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) has a similar syntax as HTML. They are both based on XML. Since HTML5 we can simply inline the code of an SVG image inside an HTML file like below.

```html
<html>
  <h1>Hi there</h1>
  <svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red" />
  </svg>
</html>
```

This opens up a lot of cool options. We can access parts of an image with JavaScript to make something interactive or we can generate art with code. We can also move some of the styling to CSS and animate image elements with CSS.

We define an `svg` element with its `width` and `height` properties. This defines the drawing canvas where the coordinates go from the `0,0` coordinate from the top-left corner and grow downwards and to the right.

<Example>

<SVG width="200" height="200">

</SVG>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <!-- Here we can place shapes -->
</svg>
```

</Example>

We can place shapes onto this canvas by coordinates. In the next chapter, we learn how to adjust this coordinate system with the [viewBox](/svg/viewbox) property.

### How to draw a Circle in SVG

To define a `circle` we need to set the following properties:

- We set its center position with the `cx` and `cy` properties.
- We set the radius with the `r`.

Drag the handlers below to see how the code gets updated.

<Embed client:load />

### Styling SVG elements

To fill the shape, we can use the `fill` property. This property is similar to the `background-color` property in CSS for regular HTML elements.

For the value of the color, we can use named color values (e.g., `red`), hex color code (e.g., `#ff0000`), or even CSS functions (e.g., `rgb(255 0 0)`). If we don't want to fill the shape, we can set it to `none`.

### How to draw a Christmas Ornament

For today's example, we draw a simple Christmas ornament. Here, we only use simple shapes: two circles and a rectangle.

First, we define the main part of the Christmas ornament by drawing a `circle`. We set its center position on the x-axis to the middle at `100` and on the y-axis, slightly below the middle at `120`. We set a large radius and set its fill color.

<Example>

<SVG width="200" height="200">
  <Circle cx="100" cy="120" r="70" fill="#D1495B" data-element-id="circle-1" />
</SVG>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <circle 
    cx="100"
    cy="120"
    r="70"
    fill="#D1495B" 
  />
</svg>
```

</Example>

Then we draw a rectangle as a little cap on top of the Christmas ornament with the `rect` element. In this case, we have to set the top-left position of the rectangle and its size. We use the `fill` attribute the same way as we did with the circle.

<Example>

<SVG width="200" height="200">
  <Circle cx="100" cy="120" r="70" fill="#D1495B" data-element-id="circle-1" />
  <Rect
    x="82"
    y="35"
    width="36"
    height="20"
    fill="#F79257"
    data-element-id="rect-1"
  />
</SVG>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html ins={8-14}
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <circle 
    cx="100"
    cy="120"
    r="70"
    fill="#D1495B" 
  />
  <rect 
    x="82" 
    y="35"
    width="36"
    height="20"
    fill="#F79257" 
  />
</svg>
```

</Example>

Finally, we add another circle as a hanger on top of these. Note that we use the same `circle` element, but with different attributes. We set the fill property to "none" and set a border for the shape with the `stroke` and `stroke-width` properties.

The final code of the image on the left is as follows:

<Final>

```html ins={4-11}
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <circle cx="100" cy="120" r="70" fill="#D1495B" />
  <rect x="82" y="35" width="36" height="20" fill="#F79257" />
  <circle
    cx="100"
    cy="25"
    r="12"
    fill="none"
    stroke="#F79257"
    stroke-width="2"
  />
</svg>
```

</Final>

Great! We drew our first SVG image. Now, let's get into something more complex!
