import SVG from "../../components/markdown/elements/SVG.astro";
import Circle from "../../components/markdown/elements/Circle.astro";
import Rect from "../../components/markdown/elements/Rect.astro";
import Example from "../../components/markdown/layouts/Example.astro";
import Note from "../../components/markdown/layouts/Note.astro";
import Final from "../../components/markdown/layouts/Final.astro";
import "./basic-shapes.scss";

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) has a similar syntax as HTML. They are both based on XML. Since HTML5 we can simply inline the code of an SVG image inside an HTML file like below.

```html
<html>
  <h1>Hi there</h1>
  <svg width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red" />
  </svg>
</html>
```

This opens up a lot of cool options. We can access parts of an image with JavaScript to make something interactive or generate art with code. We can also move the styling to CSS and animate image elements with CSS.

We define an `element:svg` element with its `property:width` and `property:height` properties. This defines the drawing canvas where the coordinates go from the `0,0` coordinate from the top-left corner and grow downwards and to the right.

<Example>

<SVG width="200" height="200">

</SVG>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <!-- Here we can place shapes -->
</svg>
```

</Example>

We can place shapes onto this canvas by coordinates. In the next chapter, we learn how to adjust this coordinate system with the [viewBox](/svg/viewbox) property.

<Note>
  The SVG element often has an `property:xmlns` property as well. If the image
  is inlined in HTML this can be omitted.
</Note>

### How to draw a Circle in SVG

For today's example, we draw a simple Christmas ornament. Here, we only use simple shapes: two circles and a rectangle.

To define a `element:circle` we need to set the following properties:

- We set its center position with the `property:cx` and `property:cy` properties.
- We set the radius with the `property:r`.

We define the main part of the Christmas ornament as a circle. We set its center position on the x-axis to the middle at `value:100` and on the y-axis, slightly below the middle at `value:120`. We set a large radius and set its fill color. Hover over the element to see how it is positioned.

<Example>

<SVG width="200" height="200">
  <Circle cx="100" cy="120" r="70" fill="#D1495B" data-element-id="circle-1" />
</SVG>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <circle 
    cx="100"
    cy="120"
    r="70"
    fill="#D1495B" 
  />
</svg>
```

</Example>

To add some color, we use the `property:fill` property. This property is similar to the `background-color` property in CSS for regular HTML elements.

The color value can be a color name like `value:red`, a hex color code like `value:#ff0000`, or a CSS function like `value:rgb(255 0 0)`. If we don't want to fill the shape, we can set it to `value:none`.

### How to draw a Rectangle in SVG

We draw a little cap on top of the Christmas ornament with the `element:rect` element:

- We set the top-left position with the `property:x` and `property:y` coordinate.
- We set the size with the `property:width` and `property:height` properties.

We position this rectangle above the previous circle and set a smaller size. Hover over the element to see how it is positioned. We use the `property:fill` attribute the same way as we did with the circle.

<Example>

<SVG width="200" height="200">
  <Circle cx="100" cy="120" r="70" fill="#D1495B" data-element-id="circle-1" />
  <Rect
    x="82"
    y="35"
    width="36"
    height="20"
    fill="#F79257"
    data-element-id="rect-1"
  />
</SVG>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html ins={8-14}
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <circle 
    cx="100"
    cy="120"
    r="70"
    fill="#D1495B" 
  />
  <rect 
    x="82" 
    y="35"
    width="36"
    height="20"
    fill="#F79257" 
  />
</svg>
```

</Example>

### How to draw a Ring in SVG

We finish the example with the hanger on top. We use the `element:circle` element again but with different attributes. Instead of filling it, we set the outline color with the `property:stroke` property and the width of this stroke with `property:stroke-width`.

We also set the `property:fill` color to `value:none` because the default value would be black.

The final code of the Christmas ornament is as follows:

<Final>

```html ins={4-11}
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <circle cx="100" cy="120" r="70" fill="#D1495B" />
  <rect x="82" y="35" width="36" height="20" fill="#F79257" />
  <circle
    cx="100"
    cy="25"
    r="12"
    fill="none"
    stroke="#F79257"
    stroke-width="2"
  />
</svg>
```

</Final>

Great! We drew our first SVG image. Now, let's get into the next challenge!
