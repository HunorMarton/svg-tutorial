Generating [images with central symmetry](/svg/rotate-and-translate) is one of the many use cases of rotating image elements. In this example, we create a clock that shows the actual time. We draw the clock with SVG and use JavaScript to turn the hour and minute handles in the right direction.

<Prerequisite slug="rotate-and-translate" />

SVG elements can be manipulated from JavaScript the same way as any other HTML element. In this example, we are using a short code snipped to show the actual time on a clock. We access the hour and minute hands in JavaScript with `getElementById` then set their `transform` attribute with a rotation that reflects the current time.

<Final>

```html "hours" "minutes"
<svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="-100 -100 200 200">
  <rect x="-100" y="-100" width="200" height="200" fill="#CD803D" />

  <circle r="55" stroke="#FCCE7B" stroke-width="10" fill="white" />

  <circle
    r="45"
    stroke="#B6705F"
    stroke-width="6"
    stroke-dasharray="6 17.56194490192345"
    stroke-dashoffset="3"
    fill="none"
  />

  <g stroke="#5f4c6c" stroke-linecap="round">
    <line id="hours" y2="-20" stroke-width="8" />
    <line id="minutes" y2="-35" stroke-width="6" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

```js /"(hours)"/ /"(minutes)"/
const hoursElement = document.getElementById("hours");
const minutesElement = document.getElementById("minutes");

const hour = new Date().getHours() % 12;
const minute = new Date().getMinutes();

hoursElement.setAttribute("transform", `rotate(${(360 / 12) * hour})`);
minutesElement.setAttribute("transform", `rotate(${(360 / 60) * minute})`);
```

</Final>

There's another trick here worth mentioning. The dots here showing each hour are drawn as a dashed circle. This works similarly as we can set the `border-style` CSS property for regular HTML elements, but more sophisticated. In SVG we can fine-tune the length of each dash segment and the space in between with the `stroke-dasharray` property. We can also set an offset with `stroke-dashoffset`.

You can find a more detailed explanation of a similar clock in this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULomsOSk4JA&t=15s).
