description: In this example we draw a Christmas Ornament with a decorational motif on the side of it with SVG and learn how to clip-path.

You can clip shapes with a mask to hide parts of the shape you don't want to see. This ornament is the same as we drew on [the first day](/svg/basic-shapes), except it has a motif on its side defined as a polyline. By default, the polyline wouldn't match the edge of the circle. Without clipping, this motif would look like this:

<Center>
  <svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="-100 -100 200 200">
    <circle cx="0" cy="20" r="70" fill="#D1495B" />
    <polyline
      points="-120 40 -80 0 -40 40 0 0 40 40 80 0 120 40"
      fill="none"
      stroke="#9C2D2A"
      stroke-width="20"
    />
    <circle
      cx="0"
      cy="-75"
      r="12"
      fill="none"
      stroke="#F79257"
      stroke-width="2"
    />
    <rect x="-17.5" y="-65" width="35" height="20" fill="#F79257" />
  </svg>
</Center>

We use clip-path here to ensure the motif fits perfectly on the ornament. The clip-path is defined in the definitions section.

Here we define a `clipPath` with an id. The content of this clip-path is a circle that matches the size of our ornament. Then we use it to clip the polyline, by setting its `clip-path` property.

<Final>

```html ins={2-4} ins={8-14} ins="ball"
<svg width="200" height="200" viewBox="-100 -100 200 200">
  <clipPath id="ball">
    <circle cx="0" cy="20" r="70" />
  </clipPath>

  <circle cx="0" cy="20" r="70" fill="#D1495B" />

  <polyline
    clip-path="url(#ball)"
    points="-120 40 -80 0 -40 40 0 0 40 40 80 0 120 40"
    fill="none"
    stroke="#9C2D2A"
    stroke-width="20"
  />

  <circle
    cx="0"
    cy="-75"
    r="12"
    fill="none"
    stroke="#F79257"
    stroke-width="2"
  />
  <rect x="-17.5" y="-65" width="35" height="20" fill="#F79257" />
</svg>
```

</Final>
