# Why would you code an image?

Why would you draw an image with code? There are designer tools for that. If all you need is a static image, a graphic designer application is probably your best choice.

The true power of coding an SVG image comes when you combine it with JavaScript or CSS. For instance, you can create a clock that shows the actual time.

<Clock />

When you combine SVGs with JavaScript, you can also make them interactive. If you click the date above, it will switch to an AM/PM indicator.

You can also generate graphics from code. You can generate data-driven diagrams, infographics, or other visualizations. Of course, there are libraries for that, like the D3 library, which also uses SVGs under the hood. But what if you need something custom, like the animation below?

In this tutorial we are going to go through 25 examples, from basic shapes through the SVG path element to more advanced use cases where we combine SVG images with JavaScript and CSS.
