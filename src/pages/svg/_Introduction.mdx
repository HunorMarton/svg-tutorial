<Why />

Why would you draw an image with code? The true power of coding an SVG image comes from combining it with JavaScript and CSS.

You can generate an infographic or a data-driven diagram. You can animate an image with CSS. You can make a clock that shows the actual time.

<div class="instruction-figure">
  <Clock simplified={true} />
  <Lightbulb />
  <Lamp />
</div>

You can make the image interactive. Try clicking the lightbulb or dragging the head of the lamp to see what happens.

In this tutorial, we go through 24 examples, from basic shapes through the SVG path element to more advanced use cases where we combine SVG images with JavaScript and CSS.
