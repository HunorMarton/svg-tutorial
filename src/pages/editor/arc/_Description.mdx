## Arc

An arc is a segment of a circle or ellipse. In SVG we can use the `<path>` element with the `A` command to draw an arc.

### Moving to the starting point

Like most path segments, the arc command continues the previous segment. In this example we use the `M` command to move to the starting point and from there we start the curve.

<Path title="M">
  <li>
    <div>
      <Input client:only="react" feature="arc" property="x1" type="number" />
      <Input client:only="react" feature="arc" property="y1" type="number" />
    </div>
  </li>
</Path>

### Drawing an Arc

The `A` command is a complex one.

<Path title="A">
<li>
  <Input
    client:only="react"
    feature="arc"
    property="rx"
    type="range"
    max={200}
  />

<Input client:only="react" feature="arc" property="ry" type="range" max={200} />

First we set the horizontal and vertical `radii` of the arc. If these are equal, the arc is on a circle. If they are different, we get an elliptical arc.

</li>

<li>
  <Input
    client:only="react"
    feature="arc"
    property="degree"
    type="range"
    max={360}
  />

Then we set a `rotation`. This value only has an effect if the previous two values are different. This is the angle of the x-axis of the ellipse relative to the x-axis of the SVG canvas.

</li>

<li>
  <Input
    client:only="react"
    feature="arc"
    property="largeArcFlag"
    type="checkbox"
  />

Then the `large arc flag` determines if the arc is reaching the end point the short way or the long way.

</li>

<li>
  <Input
    client:only="react"
    feature="arc"
    property="sweepFlag"
    type="checkbox"
  />

The `sweep flag` flag determines if the arc is drawn in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.

</li>

<li>
  <div>
    <Input client:only="react" feature="arc" property="x2" type="number" />
    <Input client:only="react" feature="arc" property="y2" type="number" />
  </div>

Finally, we set the `end point` coordinate. This is where the arc ends.

</li>

</Path>
