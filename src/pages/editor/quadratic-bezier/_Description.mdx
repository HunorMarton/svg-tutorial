## Quadratic Bézier Curve

A quadratic Bézier curve is a simple curve that bends towards a point. In SVG we can use the `<path>` element with the `Q` command to draw a curve.

### Moving to the starting point

Like most path segments, the quadratic Bézier curve command continues the previous segment. In this example we use the `M` command to move to the starting point and from there we start the curve.

<Path title="M">
  <li>
    <div>
      <Input
        client:only="react"
        feature="quadraticBezier"
        property="x0"
        type="number"
      />
      <Input
        client:only="react"
        feature="quadraticBezier"
        property="y0"
        type="number"
      />
    </div>
  </li>
</Path>

### Drawing a Quadratic Bézier Curve

The `Q` command requires a control point and an end point.

<Path title="Q">
<li>
<div>
  <Input
    client:only="react"
    feature="quadraticBezier"
    property="x1"
    type="number"
  />
  <Input
    client:only="react"
    feature="quadraticBezier"
    property="y1"
    type="number"
  />
  </div>

First we set the control point. The curve bends towards this point.

</li>

<li>
<div>
  <Input
    client:only="react"
    feature="quadraticBezier"
    property="x"
    type="number"
  />
  <Input
    client:only="react"
    feature="quadraticBezier"
    property="y"
    type="number"
  />
</div>

Then we set the end point. This is where the curve ends.

</li>

</Path>
